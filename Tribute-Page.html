            <h2>About Mahakavi Bharati</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> &emsp;Bharathi was born on 11 December 1882 in the village of Ettayapuram, to Chinnaswami
                    Subramania Iyer
                    and Lakshmi Ammal. </li><br>
                <li> &emsp;Bharathi's mother died in 1887 and two years later, his father also died. At the age of 11,
                    in 1893
                    his prowess as a poet was recognised and he was accorded the title of 'bharathi'. He was a student
                    at Nellai Hindu School and in 1897 he married Sellamal. Thererafter, from 1898 to 1902, he lived in
                    Kasi.</li><br>
                <li> &emsp;Bharathi worked as a school teacher and as a journal editor at various times in his life. As
                    a
                    Tamil
                    poet he ranked with Ilanko, Thiruvalluvar and Kamban.</li><br>
                <li> &emsp;His writings gave new life to the Tamil language - and to Tamil national consciousness.</li><br>
                <li> &emsp;He involved himself actively in the Indian freedom struggle. </li><br>
                <li> &emsp;Bharathi often referred to Tamil as his 'mother'. At the sametime, he was fluent in many languages
                    including Bengali, Hindi, Sanskrit, Kuuch, and English and frequently translated works from other
                    languages into Tamil</li><br>
                <li> &emsp;His
                    <br><b>
                    யாமறிந்த மொழிகளிலே தமிழ்மொழி போல்<br>
                    இனிதாவது எங்கும் காணோம்</b></li><br>

                    (among all the languages we know, we do not see anywhere, any as sweet as Tamil) was his moving
                    tribute to his mother tongue. That many a Tamil web site carries the words of that song on its home
                    page in cyber space today is a reflection of the hold that those words continue to have on Tamil
                    minds and Tamil hearts.

                    <li> &emsp;He wrote in 'Vande Matharam' :
                        <br><b>
                            ஜாதி மதங்களைப் பாரோம் -<br>
                            உயர் ஜன்மம்இத் தேசத்தில் எய்தின ராயின்<br>
                            வேதிய ராயினும் ஒன்றே -<br>
                            அன்றி வேறு குலத்தின ராயினும் ஒன்றே</b><br><br>

                        We shall not look at caste or religion, All human beings in this land
                        - whether they be those who preach the vedas or who belong to other castes - are one.
                    </li><br>
                    <li> &emsp;Bharathi served as Assistant Editor of the Swadeshamitran in 1904.He participated in the
                        1906 All
                        India Congress meeting in Calcutta (chaired by Dadabhai Naoroji) where the demand for 'Swaraj'
                        was
                        raised for the first time. Bharathi supported the demand wholeheartedly and found himself in the
                        militant wing of the Indian National Congress together with Tilak and Aurobindo. Aurobindo
                        writing
                        on the historic 1906 Congress had this to say:
                        <br>&emsp; "We were prepared to give the old weakness of the congress plenty of time to die out if we
                        could
                        get realities recognised. Only in one particular have we been disappointed and that is the
                        President's address. But even here the closing address with which Mr.Naoroji dissolved the
                        Congress,
                        has made amends for the deficiencies of his opening speech.

                        <br>&emsp;He once more declared Self-Government, Swaraj, as in an inspired moment he termed it, to be
                        our
                        one ideal and called upon the young men to achieve it. The work of the older men had been done
                        in
                        preparing a generation which were determined to have this great ideal and nothing else; the work
                        of
                        making the ideal a reality lies lies with us. We accept Mr. Naoroji's call and to carry out his
                        last
                        injunctions will devote our lives and, if necessary, sacrifice them." (Bande Mataram, 31
                        December
                        1906)
                    </li><br>
                    <li> &emsp;Bharathy met with Mahatma Gandhi in 1919 and in 1920, Bharathy resumed editorship of the
                        Swadeshamitran in Madras. That was one year before his death in 1921. Today, more than 80 years
                        later, Subaramanya Bharathy, despite his frailties, stands as an undying symbol of Indian
                        freedom
                        and a vibrant Tamil nationalism.</li><br>
                    <li> &emsp;Bharathi died on 11 September 1921. In a relatively short life span of 39 years, Bharathi
                        left an
                        indelible mark as the poet of Tamil nationalism and Indian freedom.</li><br>
